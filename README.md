# Optimized Routes System

An interactive system that calculates the shortest routes between points using Dijkstra's algorithm. Built with React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, this application provides an intuitive way to optimize travel routes.

## About

The **Optimized Routes System** uses **Dijkstra's algorithm** to calculate the shortest distance between two or more locations on a map. Users can input a starting point and destination, and the system will find the optimal route, taking into account distances and possible obstacles.

The frontend is built using **React** for a dynamic, responsive user interface, while the backend leverages **Node.js** and **Express** for handling API requests and performing the Dijkstra algorithm calculations.

## Features

- <strong>Shortest Path Calculation</strong>: Using Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest route between two points.
- <strong>Route Visualization</strong>: Visual representation of the route on a map for better understanding.
- <strong>Interactive Interface</strong>: Users can interactively select start and end points to get real-time optimized routes.
- <strong>Backend Optimization</strong>: Efficient route calculation on the server-side for fast response times.

## Backend

The backend is built with **Node.js** and **Express**, providing a simple API for route optimization.

### API Endpoints

<pre>
GET /api/route: Calculate the shortest route between a start and end point.
  
  Query Parameters:
    - start: The starting point (latitude, longitude)
    - end: The destination point (latitude, longitude)

  Response:
    {
      "path": [
        { "lat": 40.748817, "lng": -73.985428 },
        { "lat": 40.748256, "lng": -73.985192 }
      ],
      "distance": 1.2
    }
</pre>

### Dijkstra's Algorithm in the Backend

The backend performs the shortest path calculation using **Dijkstra's algorithm**, which finds the shortest path in a weighted graph. The nodes in this graph represent locations, and the edges represent the distances between them.

## Frontend

The frontend is built with **React** for a seamless, user-friendly experience. It allows users to:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Input Start and End Points</strong>: Enter locations manually or click on a map.</li>
  <li><strong>View Route</strong>: See the shortest path visually on an interactive map.</li>
  <li><strong>Real-Time Updates</strong>: Updates the route dynamically as users adjust the start and end points.</li>
</ul>
